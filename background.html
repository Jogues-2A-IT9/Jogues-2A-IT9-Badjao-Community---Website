	<p>
Having validated and concretized the community profile we formed about our partner institution, the biggest problem they face is the low income of households. Poverty is the lack of access to basic needs such as food, safe water, clean air, shelter, hygiene, sanitation, medical aid, and basic education. 
</p>
<br>
	<p>
		Poverty has been around for a long time dating back to cavemen striving to survive in the wild but it was only after the second world war in 1945 that it was deemed a global issue. Having unmet basic needs can affect children and adults with adverse physical and mental health outcomes and mortality. Children as young as infants that lack basic nutrition from food are likely to have a lower life expectancy than well-fed children. Not only that but it can affect physical and motor development permanently. Education is another basic need for everyone yet it is not always met, and this can cause illiteracy which is a cause for poverty, as well as decrease the odds to give people better lives. The Badjao Communityâ€™s mission is to serve as a model for the populace of Badjaos and they are to serve it by giving the community empowerment in their lives. Solving poverty or the lack of basic needs will result in prosperity in health and productivity. This is because people will not constantly worry about surviving with their primary needs but will think of how to thrive in terms of work, relationships, education, and many more, thus creating a better chance for them to get a better life because they get to have options. 
	</p>
	<br/><p>
The proposal we are offering them is making composting a business. What we mean by this is that we will provide them with a proposal for a composting business in the community so that they can get more income in the households by selling crops they grow and produce. 
	</p>
	<br/><p>
Our project proposal aims to aid in food security and less waste in the community. We want to extend a helping hand to the Badjao Community because we have the ability to help them, and we try to spread the knowledge of composting to other people when we see fit. Sustainability is a major factor that we considered in the planning of our project proposal. A worldwide problem that we decided to tackle or give aid to is food insecurity. Through composting, we promote planting and growing crops at home, which makes fresh and safe food much more accessible to many. Less waste in the community is another factor in reaching sustainability, so we intend to promote composting as it reduces the carbon footprint in the environment, through the use of biodegradable materials such as food waste, scrap paper, etc which are needed for the composting mixture.

	<br/><center><h2>Significance of the Proposed Project</h2></center>
	<p>
	This case study examines the situation of the Badjao, specifically catering to their needs. The study will be used as the basis for the development of a holistic intervention program in answering the empirical needs of their families and to determine solutions to issues related to their educational needs and health. In relation, it will also correct the misconceptions stereotyping the minds of the people in the province about the Badjao community. This project promotes community participation and unites communities to conduct team projects related to composting which will adhere to the Advocacy of the Badjao Community of Matina Apalaya (BCAMA). This project makes people become productive in solving their problems and becoming self-sufficient and empowered.

	<br/><center><h2>Our Purpose and Mission</h2></center>
	<p>
	Our purpose is to adhere to the 5 Ignatian values which are Magis, Cura Personalis, Men and Women for others, Finding God in all things, and Social Justice, while providing aid to communal problems we encounter. We would like to inspire our peers to support institutions with a great cause. We want to be a good example in our community by supporting and aiding institutions and organizations whose advocacies are to protect, conserve, maintain, enhance, and/or lead a great example to the populace of a community.
	</p>
	<center><h2>Our Vision</h2></center>
	<p>
	We aspire to be a community with unity and camaraderie that embraces a safe and healthy environment for each of the members of the tribe including their physical, emotional, mental, career and spiritual aspect. We also seek to empower especially children who will be the future and the hope of their change in families, Christianity, and culture that will enable them to prove themselves that they are capable of giving themselves priorities and values that other people thought they cannot. Accomplishing these through developing their inner person showing how to love and care for their family and community, how to live with dignity and peace, represent what is best for their culture, develop responsibility to themselves and the community, and be a great role for them to see what is a real driven and better community is. Working together in peace will help us reach the success of the vision provided for the better living of every Filipino people.
