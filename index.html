			<center><h2>WHO ARE THE BADJAOS IN THE COMMUNITY?</h2></center>
			<center><img src = "imgs.png" width = "800" height = "630"></center>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			The Badjaos are referred to as a “sea-dwelling” tribe, known as Sea Nomads or Sea Gypsies as well. They are an ethnic group who primarily inhabits the coastlines of some countries in Southeast Asia. They are renowned for weaving sails that are vibrant and creative. They trade and fish to support their livelihood. In Davao City, Badjaos have been seen asking for alms on the streets. In a normal sea-dwelling community, children often play and swim in the water meant for human waste disposal. This can lead to gastrointestinal problems, eye diseases, and other skin infections. Some of the Badjaos have been involved in the purchase and selling of used and knock off shoes. Along the coastlines, some Badjaos have begun to establish villages. One of these communities is the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.
			<br><br>
			The institution has its eyes on their goal of creating a better future for Badjaos and their family and community. Creating a more interconnected community, they can only be described as one big family all looking out for each other as you would expect a community would. A family which they wholly made everyone feel a part of. They accommodate volunteers who are willing to support and provide for the institution. The link between volunteers and the badjao community is a special one, the impact of the partnership on both parties is visible to some degree. All we can say is we felt not only feeling welcomed, we felt the realness and transparency of the Badjao Association in Matina Aplaya Incorporation’s institution towards its beneficiaries.

			<center><h2>THE ADVOCACY</h2></center>
			<p>
			The Advocacy of the Badjao Association of Aplaya aims to serve as a model community for the Badjao community by setting an example to the Badjaos to be empowered and capacitated. In the community there are programs and services that cater to the needs of the Badjao both physiologically and intellectually. Their community is there to provide a safe space for Badjaos with the intention to come together as a community to aid communal problems.
			</p>
			<br><center><h2>THEIR ACTIVITIES</h2></center>
			<p>
			As one group, the Badjao Association held different events promoting distinct livelihood programs among their members such as job opportunities, health planning, and they also implemented literacy programs for adults and pre-school children. In that sense, there is an alternative learning school established inside the Badjao Association of Matina Aplaya which is the “Iskul Pangandaran Saga Badjao'', to further literate the Badjaos in reading and writing their own language.
			<br>
			<br><center><h2>THE ORGANIZER AND THEIR HISTORY</h2></center>
			<p>
			
The institution was established by <b>Pastor Felicismo “Jun” Morales,</b> together with his wife who lived with the Badjao in Isla Verde for more than 8 years. They aim to serve as a model among the inhabitants of the Badjao Community. Furthermore, the institution started with roughly 35 families until it expanded more, resulting in more than 178 members inside the community today.

			<br><center><h2>WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS AND PRESSING ISSUES THAT THE COMMUNITY IS FACING?</h2></center>
			<p>
			The Badjao Community are facing several circumstances in their daily lives. According to Miss Melody Adjari, an ALS teacher who answered the question forms regarding the challenges and needs of the Badjao Community, she stated that they encountered pressing issues in the institution regarding basic needs, especially food security. She also includes that due to the pandemic and lockdown, they have lost their business capital causing them to have conflicts in affording the basic needs of the members inside. Not only the basic needs but also the medicines such as paracetamol, pampurga, bandage, basically the needs inside of the first aid kit and the electronic gadgets needed by the students for their online classes. Furthermore, their environmental condition is poor for the reason that their wastes are not properly disposed of. Resulting in improper waste disposal.
			</p>
			<br><center><h2>WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION?</h2></center>
			<p>
			The needs of the institution are a stable source of income and assets. In this way, they’ll be able to provide the fundamental necessities of the Badjao Community inside the Institution even in the toughest time. These are the main reasons why the institution cannot uphold themselves from facing different communal problems, this is due to lack of stable income and assets resulting in conflicts with acquiring their basic necessities, medical needs, and education system. Moreover, Ateneo once provided waste segregation to maintain the cleanliness of the Institution’s Environment. In that sense, improper waste disposal could not create turbulence around the community such as contamination and pollution that could possibly have its health consequences towards the Badjao Community. As stated also by Miss Melody, we can assist them through online communication.
