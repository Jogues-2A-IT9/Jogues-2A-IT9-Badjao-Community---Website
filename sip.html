		<br><center><h3>Background and Significance of the Study</h3></center>
		<center><img src = "sciimg.png" width = "800" height = "630"></center>
		<br><p>The common problem in the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya is the food insecurity. Our SIP aims to aid this issue with composting. We shall address this issue by teaching people how to use composted soil for their plants and use Urban Container Gardening (UCG) so that they will be able to foster food security. Composting locally at the neighborhood or community-level yields many other benefits: social inclusion and empowerment, greener neighborhoods, improved local soils, enhanced food security, fewer food deserts, less truck traffic hauling garbage, more local jobs, and increased composting know-how and skills within the local workforce that is reinforced in the next generation. We will use food waste like eggshells in our compost. Our experiment is about "The effect of compost amount in the soil to the growth of cabbage in terms of weight.‚Äù The purpose of this experiment is to prove the effectiveness of our Composting Business. Which, we will be selling compost to people to encourage them to buy our product as a more effective soil for growing plants. One of our activities is teaching people specifically the Badjao Community to compost so they can foster food security.</p>

		<br><center><h3>Statement of the Problem</h3></center>
		<center><p>Is the increased amount of composted soil really effective to the growth of cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis)?</p></center>

		<br><center><h3>Hypothesis</h3></center>
		<center><p>If an increasing amount of eggshell is added in the soil, then it will significantly affect the growth of the cabbage <i>(Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis)</i>.</p></center>

		<br><center><h2>Review of Related Literature</h2></center>
		<p>The methods of disposing various quantities of organic wastes produced for farming has been a topic for many years. Composting of organic wastes has become a main method of waste reduction, disposal because it produces a final product and can be beneficial applied to land (Haug ,2013). It also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the quantity of material that is landfilled and decomposed, a process that produces methane (Daigle, 2009). It is the microbial comversion of organic matter in the presence of suitable amounts of air and moisture into a humus-like product (Bertoldi, 2013).</p>
		<br><p>Composting has been investigated for use as a substitute landfill or as an alternative plant soil media (Cawton, 2009). In order to compost, the material must be physically and chemically match to the landscape to ensure standards are met.</p>
		<br><p>Most compost has a pH in the neutral range, organic matter content in the 30% 
to 60% range, moisture content in the 30% to 50% range, and higher values of N, P, K, and salts than typical agricultural soils. Some compost (especially compost derived from 
MSW) typically has higher levels of trace metals especially Cu, Zn, and Pb, which can 
cause accumulation problems in soils with repeated applications (Henery, 2012).</p>
		<br><p>Potential problems with compost use include quality, nutrient loss through erosion and 
leaching, accumulation of heavy metals, and the introduction of high salt levels.</p>
